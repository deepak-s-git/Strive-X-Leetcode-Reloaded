# 🚀 Strive-X-Leetcode-Reloaded

> A pattern-based, structured roadmap to mastering LeetCode — rebuilt from scratch, one pattern at a time.

---

## 📘 Overview

**Strive-X-Leetcode-Reloaded** is a comprehensive collection of **LeetCode solutions organized by problem-solving patterns**, designed for in-depth understanding, efficient revision, and interview readiness.

Every folder represents a **key DSA pattern**, and each C++ file includes:
- 📜 Problem description  
- 💡 Intuition behind the solution  
- ⏱️ Time & Space complexity  
- ✅ Clean, well-commented code  

This project marks the completion of a full, pattern-wise reloaded journey of LeetCode.

| **Binary Search** | Search space, peaks, boundaries |
| **Bit Manipulation** | XOR, masks, power of two |
| **DFS and BFS** | Traversal, flood fill, islands |
| **Dynamic Programming** | LIS, knapsack, grid paths |
| **Fast-Slow Pointers** | Cycle detection, middle finding |
| **Graph** | Paths, connectivity, Union-Find |
| **Greedy** | Intervals, jumps, scheduling |
| **Heap** | Priority queue, top-k, merging |
| **In-Place Reversal Of A Linked List** | Reversals, rotations, pair swaps |
| **Intervals** | Merging, overlapping, insertion |
| **Sliding Window** | Substrings, max/min, k-window |
| **Trie** | Prefix tree, autocomplete |
| **Two Pointers** | Pairs, triplets, partitions |
| **Union Find** | DSU, Kruskal’s MST |
| **Sorting / QuickSelect / Bucket Sort** | Order statistics, partitioning |

## 💡 Why Pattern-Based Learning?

Instead of solving problems randomly, this approach focuses on **pattern recognition** — learning the reusable templates that form the foundation of most problems.  

This ensures:
- ⚡ Faster identification of problem types  
- 🧠 Reuse of known strategies across topics  
- 🧩 Deep conceptual clarity  
- 💬 Smooth interview explanations

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Language:** C++17  
- **Environment:** VS Code / Xcode  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  
- **Documentation:** Markdown (embedded inside each file)
